# ui design tools
This project defines some useful design related controls which you can use to aid you in generating css.

## Technologies Used
### Closure Javascript Templates
One of the goals of this project was to evaluate Google's Closure library for client-side templating.
Closure templates are pretty intuitive.  I only got frustrated a few times :) when performing conditional statements inside of the template.
Make sure you are using spaces ' ' and not tabs '\t' when editing your soy files.  Tabs caused wide gaps in the css that I was generating.

Closure is a big tool though, and js templating is just one of its facets.  
I mainly stuck to these pages for guidance in generating js templates:
