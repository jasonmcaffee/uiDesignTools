finish css3 gradient generation.

- for more options

color picker
 x tiny boxes. each box N px in height&width
 x hue color slider - requires refactor of template..
 x click event registry is bad approach for colorBoxes. fix it! (duplicate event listens, etc)
 - modal popup - kind of complete
 - when hue range color changes, change minimized of colorPicker to match color. pick 50 for saturation and brightness.
 - reverse hsv from rgb calculation.
 - set hue color of slider when input ranges for rgb change?
 x alpha value of color stop is getting changed when clicking colorBox

colorBoxes has an extra row - get rid of it.

linearGradientMakerWidget - needs inheritance. outputs go to gradientMakerWidget?

circular gradient
elliptical gradient
repeating gradients!


for css3 effects, separate out bad browsers. eg. android 2.3 sucks with scrolling and drop shadow.

rounded corners

drop shadow

text


presets

pallets
share palletes



- for various browsers x kind of done


============= DONE ========================================
fix alpha .01. make 1-100 range and modify before write.
fix background to background-image
-- directions - top left, top, top right, left, right, bottom left, bottom, bottom right

-select values not going to work. need to modify when gen css -- alpha slider

- polyfill for input type="range"

onclick event needed for color box. broke right now
 - using colorBoxes instead of colorBoxRow.colorBoxes
