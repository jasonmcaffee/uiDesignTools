box shadow - allow skews like http://www.wordpressthemeshock.com/css-drop-shadow/
support adding multiple box shadows

finish css3 gradient generation.

dont redraw all the radio buttons on click, just replace the image.

get intellij project configured. xxxx

- for more options

final output view???


gradientsPageWidget has html generated, modifies dom,  and then geneerates html for linear gradient, and then modifies dom. do it all at once if possible.

colorBoxes has an extra row - get rid of it.

linearGradientMakerWidget - needs inheritance. outputs go to gradientMakerWidget?

circular gradient
elliptical gradient
repeating gradients!


for css3 effects, separate out bad browsers. eg. android 2.3 sucks with scrolling and drop shadow.

rounded corners

drop shadow

text


presets

pallets
share palletes



- for various browsers x kind of done




================== ALMOST DONE ================================
color picker
 x tiny boxes. each box N px in height&width
 x hue color slider - requires refactor of template..
 x click event registry is bad approach for colorBoxes. fix it! (duplicate event listens, etc)
 x modal popup - not a popup any more. simply expands
 x when hue range color changes, change minimized of colorPicker to match color. pick 50 for saturation and brightness.
 - reverse hsv from rgb calculation.
 - set hue color of slider when input ranges for rgb change?
 x alpha value of color stop is getting changed when clicking colorBox


============= DONE ========================================
fix alpha .01. make 1-100 range and modify before write.
fix background to background-image
-- directions - top left, top, top right, left, right, bottom left, bottom, bottom right

-select values not going to work. need to modify when gen css -- alpha slider

- polyfill for input type="range"

onclick event needed for color box. broke right now
 - using colorBoxes instead of colorBoxRow.colorBoxes
